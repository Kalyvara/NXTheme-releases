# About

In this repository, you'll find documentation for my *main* NX theme pack releases [available on Themezer](https://themezer.net/creators/382997176307154945). This might be useful if you want to customize my themes with your own colors or make some minor edits to them. This also means don't expect me to take any more requests for such changes.

Each directory from this repository corresponds to a specific release. For your convenience, files that might be useful to you are included in each directory, i.e. `.json` codes and background images (along with their associated `.psd` if possible).

As of now, my main releases are

- **[Spotify Deck](https://themezer.net/packs/Spotify-Deck-596)**
- **[Octave](https://themezer.net/packs/Octave-538)**
- **[Unison](https://themezer.net/packs/Unison-523)**
- **P5G: Persona 5 Golden**
  - [1:1 icons](https://themezer.net/packs/P5G-Persona-5-Golden-4e9)
  - [Vertical icons](https://themezer.net/packs/P5G-Persona-5-Golden-version-2-4f7)

Credits are appreciated if you intend to submit your edited layout on Themezer...
